# :tomato: Pomodoro

Just another generic pomodoro timer, with a tomatoes counter for each pomodoro session you've been through. Also, it fires notifications whenever you complete a pomodoro session.

### :memo: May I copy your project and use it elsewhere like I was the real architect of this software engineering masterpiece?

Yap, feel free to do whatever you want with the project's code :)
